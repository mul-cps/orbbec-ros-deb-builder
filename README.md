This repo contains a GitHub workflow that builds binary Debian packages for the [Orbbec ROS 2 package](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS2). See the [branches](https://github.com/mul-cps/orbbec-ros-deb-builder/branches) for a target Ubuntu and ROS distribution and follow the instructions there on how to add the Debian repo to your system.
